Welcome aboard, fellow coders! Today, we're going on an exciting journey to set up a Java development environment on Mac OS. Our travel companions for this adventure will be SDKMAN and Jenv. Think of them as our trusty Swiss Army knives, packed with all the tools we need for our expedition.

## SDKMAN: The Tool Supplier

First, let's meet SDKMAN. It's a software development kit manager that helps us manage multiple versions of various software development kits. It's like a toolbox that keeps all our tools neatly organized and within easy reach.

### Installing SDKMAN

To invite SDKMAN into our journey, we'll use the following command:

```markdown
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```

### Installing Java and Maven with SDKMAN

Next, we need to equip ourselves with Java and Maven. SDKMAN makes this as easy as ordering a cup of coffee. Here's how:

```bash
sdk list java
sdk install java 17-open
sdk default java 17-open

sdk list maven
sdk install maven 3.9.5
sdk default maven 3.9.5
```

## Jenv: The Path Guide

Now, let's introduce Jenv, our path guide. Jenv is a command line tool that helps us manage our Java environment. It's like a GPS that helps us navigate through different versions of Java.

### Installing Jenv

To bring Jenv into our journey, we'll use the following command:

```bash
brew install jenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.jenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(jenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
jenv enable-plugin export
jenv jenv enable-plugin maven
jenv enable-plugin gradle
```

### Setting up Java Version with Jenv

Finally, we need to set up our Java version with Jenv. This is like setting our destination on the GPS. Here's how:

```bash
jenv add /Users/argszero/.sdkman/candidates/java/17-open
jenv versions
jenv global 17
```

And voila! We've successfully set up our Java development environment on Mac OS using SDKMAN and Jenv. With these tools in our arsenal, we're ready to conquer any Java project that comes our way. Happy coding!
