Imagine a merry-go-round, where each horse is a number from an array. Now, let's say we want to rotate this merry-go-round by a certain number of steps, `k`, to the right. This is essentially what we're doing when we're asked to rotate an array. 

Let's take an example:

```javascript
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
Rotate 1 step to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
Rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
Rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

If `k` is equal to the length of the array, the array doesn't change. To simplify the operation, we can set `k = k % nums`. For any element `i` in the array, we can calculate its new position after the rotation as `(i + k)%nums`. However, we can't directly move the elements, because the original element at position `(i + k)%nums` would be lost. To solve this problem, we first need to make a copy of the array.

Here's the code implementation:

```javascript
var rotate = function (nums, k) {
    k = k % nums.length;
    const copy=[...nums];
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const target_index =(nums.length+i-k)%nums.length;
        nums[i] = copy[target_index]
    }
    return nums;
};
```

The time complexity of this code is O(n), and the space complexity is also O(n), because we make a copy of the array, which consumes extra memory.

But what if we only copy the element that is being replaced? We can do this by following these steps:


_1. Copy the element at position `a` to `tmp`.

_2. Copy the element at position `b` to position `a`.

_3. Copy the element at position `c` to position `b`.

...

_n. Copy the element at position `a` to position `n` (Note that the element at position `a` is actually in `tmp`, so we are copying `tmp` to position `n`).

Here's the code implementation:

```javascript
var rotate = function (nums, k) {
    k = k % nums.length;
    let count=0;
    let start = 0;
    let target=start;
    let target_value = nums[start];
    for(;;count++){
        if(count===nums.length)break;
        let source = (target+nums.length -k)%nums.length;
        nums[target]=source==start?target_value:nums[source];
        target=source;
        if(target===start){
            start++;
            target_value = nums[start];
            target=start;
        };
    }
    return nums;
};
```

The time complexity of this code is still O(n), but the space complexity is now O(1).

Finally, since we're using JavaScript, we can also use JavaScript's built-in array function `splice` to achieve the same result:

1. Use the modulus operator `%` to ensure that `k` does not exceed the length of the array, to avoid unnecessary operations.
2. Use the `splice` method to cut `k` elements from the end of the array and make them a new subarray.
3. Use the `splice` method to insert this subarray at the beginning of the array, to achieve the rotation to the right by `k` positions.

Here's the code implementation:

```javascript
var rotate = function(nums, k) {
    k = k % nums.length
    nums.splice(0,0,...nums.splice(-k))
};
```

And there you have it - the merry-go-round of numbers, spinning to the right, all thanks to the magic of JavaScript!
